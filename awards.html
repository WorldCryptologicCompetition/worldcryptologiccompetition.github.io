		<p>In the WCC, prizes are awarded to the entrants of the best entries, according to the judging,
			and awards are also given to the judges to compensate them for their several months of hard work.</p>
		<p>In the first year, WCC 2023, awards will be extra-generous, to make up for two factors.
			Firstly, awards will be in the form of a new cryptocurrency, according to a percentage of, for 1 calendar year, the amount generated at the project's main address (donation address).
			Secondly, there will be a significant delay to awards being distributed, as the cryptocurrency project will need to be completed.
			The awards will begin to be distributed within 1 year of the WCC 2023's conclusion.
		</p>
		<p>
			To rephrase:
			<ul>
				<li>Sometime between late 2023 (November/December 2023) and early/mid 2024 there will be a new cryptocurrency.</li>
				<li>The cryptocurrency project will use algorithms from WCC 2023.</li>
				<li>The cryptocurrency project will have a donation address that funds the project.</li>
				<li>10 &percnt; of the total amount sent to the project donation address will be put into the WCC fund. This percentage may change in some future year.</li>
				<li>10 &percnt; of the total balance in the WCC fund at the time of awards distribution will be total amount of awards for that year.</li>
				<li>A participant&apos;s "Prize Weight" determines their proportion of the total amount.</li>
			</ul>
