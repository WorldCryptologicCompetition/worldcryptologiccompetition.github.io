		<p>In the WCC, prizes are awarded to the entrants of the best entries, according to the judging,
			and awards are also given to the judges to compensate them for their several months of hard work.</p>
		<p>In the first year, WCC 2023, awards will be extra-generous, to make up for two factors.
			Firstly, awards will be in the form of a new cryptocurrency, according to a percentage of, for 1 calendar year, the amount generated at the project's main address (donation address).
			Secondly, there will be a significant delay to awards being distributed, as the cryptocurrency project will need to be completed.
			The awards will begin to be distributed within 1 year of the WCC 2023's conclusion.
