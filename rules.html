			<h2>Rules for Entries for WCC 2023</h2>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Rule 1: License</strong> Each entry shall be placed into the public domain</li>
				<li><strong>Rule 2: Reference Implementation</strong> Each entry shall contain a C implementation that conforms to the interface standard</li>
				<li><strong>Rule 3: Professionalism</strong> Each entry shall be documented and seem professional, well composed, and polished</li>
				<li><strong>Rule 4: Innovation</strong> Each entry shall be novel- unique and significantly distinct from existing algorithms. Examples of acceptable adaptations are AES into WHIRLPOOL, Threefish into Skein, or Radio-Gatun into SHA-3</li>
				<li><strong>Rule 5: Output Length</strong> Each entry must have, at least, the 512-bit output variation</li>
				<li><strong>Rule 6: Modification of Entries</strong> As the competition proceeds, there are numerous opportunities to modify entries Each modification must be limited to changes of small complexity, such as fixing comments/markup errors, trivial mistakes, number of rounds, margin calculations, estimations, and etc. Constants, S-Boxes, and permutations are allowed to be modified in the first round, but not in the Finalist Round and the preceeding opportunity.</li>
				<li><strong>Rule 7: Multiple Entries</strong> If a single team (entrant) submits more than one entry, the entries should be very different, with no obvious similarities</li>
				<li><strong>Rule 8: Non-Trivial Entries</strong> Entries shall not be trivial. For example: "f(x) = SHA3(x) XOR SHA2(x)" is not an acceptable entry</li>
				<li><strong>Rule 9: Derivitive Works</strong> Entries shall not be derivitive works from other entries</li>
				<li><strong>Rule 10: Size Limit</strong> The total size of all constats, S-Boxes, and etc, cannot exceed 2^25 bits = 2^22 bytes (4MB)</li>
