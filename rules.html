			<h2>General Rules applying to All Entries in the WCC 2023</h2>
			<ol class='ruleList'>
				<li><strong>Rule G-1, "License":</strong> Each entry shall be placed into the public domain</li>
				<li><strong>Rule G-2, "Professionalism":</strong> Each entry shall be documented and seem professional, well composed, and polished</li>
				<li><strong>Rule G-3, "Innovation":</strong> Each entry shall be novel- unique and significantly distinct from existing algorithms. Examples of acceptable adaptations are AES into WHIRLPOOL, Threefish into Skein, or Radio-Gatun into SHA-3</li>
				<li><strong>Rule G-4, "Reference Implementation":</strong> Each entry shall contain a C implementation that conforms to the interface standard</li>
				<li><strong>Rule G-5, "Modification of Entries":</strong> As the competition proceeds, there are numerous opportunities to modify entries. Each modification must be limited to changes of small complexity, such as fixing comments/markup errors, trivial mistakes, number of rounds, margin calculations, estimations, and etc. Constants, S-Boxes, and permutations are allowed to be modified in the first round, but not in the Finalist Round and the preceeding opportunity.</li>
				<li><strong>Rule G-6, "Multiple Entries":</strong> If a single team (entrant) submits more than one entry in a single category, the entries should be very different, with no obvious similarities</li>
				<li><strong>Rule G-7, "Size Limit":</strong> The total size of all constants, S-Boxes, and etc, cannot exceed 2<sup>25</sup> bits = 2<sup>22</sup> bytes (4MB)</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			<h2>Rules applying to Category A Entries (block ciphers) in the WCC 2023</h2>
			<ol class='ruleList'>
				<li><strong>Rule A-1, "Block Size":</strong> Each entry must have a 512-bit block</li>
				<li><strong>Rule A-2, "Key Size":</strong> Each entry must have a 512-bit key</li>
				<li><strong>Rule A-3, "Nonce Size":</strong> Each entry must have a 192-bit nonce</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			<h2>Rules applying to Category B Entries (digest functions) in the WCC 2023</h2>
			<ol class='ruleList'>
				<li><strong>Rule B-1, "Output Size":</strong> Each entry must have, at least, the 512-bit output variation</li>
				<li><strong>Rule B-2, "Key Size":</strong> Each entry must have a 512-bit key</li>
				<li><strong>Rule B-3, "Nonce Size":</strong> Each entry must have a 192-bit nonce</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			<h2>Rules applying to Category C Entries (stream ciphers) in the WCC 2023</h2>
			<ol class='ruleList'>
				<li><strong>Rule C-1, "Key Size":</strong> Each entry must have a 512-bit key</li>
				<li><strong>Rule C-2, "Nonce Size":</strong> Each entry must have a 192-bit nonce</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			<h2>Rules for Judging/Scoring in the WCC 2023</h2>
			<ol class='ruleList'>
				<li><strong>Rule JS-1: "Security":</strong> Each entry should be subjected to the same or similar tests to derive this score. A Judge does not need to explain his methods.</li>
				<li><strong>Rule JS-2: "Innovation":</strong> Entirely subjective, within the setting of a Judge's knowledge and awareness of existing technologies and other entries. A Judge does not need to explain this score.</li>
				<li><strong>Rule JS-3: "Speed":</strong> Speed is measured on a mondern 64-bit PC running a POSIX-compliant OS such as a Unix, Linux, BSD, or Apple OS X. The machine and OS is the Judge's choice. No other implementation / model-of-computation is considered. All entries must be judged on the same platform in the same or similar environment. A Judge does not need to explain his methods.</li>
				<li><strong>Rule JS-4: "Aesthetics":</strong> Entirely subjective. A Judge does not need to explain this score.</li>
