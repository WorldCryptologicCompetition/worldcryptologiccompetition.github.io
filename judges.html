			WCC Judges are experts from academia and industry. The minimum requirements to be a judge is any of: An academic degree (MS or PhD)
			with a crypto-related specialization, published crypto-related academic work in a peer-reviewed setting, or well-known and studied
			open-source work in crypto.
		</p>
		<p>
			In WCC 2023 there are two classes of judge: "Judge", and "Distinguished Judge".
			There is no difference between the weight of vote from the two classes; but in the event of a true tie; if it is possible to break the tie
			by only counting votes from Distinguished Judges, then that will be done. In addition, Distinguished Judges are awarded more for their work.
			Examples of someone who would qualify to be a "Distinguished Judge" would be Kaisa Nyberg, Ron Rivest, Vincent Rijmen, John Kelsey, Don Coppersmith, or Bruce Schneier.
			Distinguished Judges, if any, will be chosen from the pool of Judges after the registration/submissions phase ends (Phase 1).
