			The World Cryptologic Competition (WCC) is a worldwide open competition. The WCC itself is based in the United States.
			The WCC 2023 is the WCC's first year.
		<p>
			In most ways similar to the AES competition in 2001 (the "Advanced Encryption Standard process"), the World Cryptologic Competition
			looks to produce real value by production of innovative new algorithms, results, methods, and products (such as new cryptocurrencies).
		</p>
		<p>
			The WCC 2023 has 3 entry categories: Category A (Block Cipers), Category B (Digest Functions), and Category C (Stream Ciphers).
			In future years there will also be categories for analysis and invention- and perhaps others as well.
