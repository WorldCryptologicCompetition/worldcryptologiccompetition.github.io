			The World Cryptologic Competition (WCC) is a worldwide open competition. The WCC itself is based in the United States.
			The WCC 2023 is the WCC's first year.
		<p>
			In most ways similar to the AES competition in 2001 (the "Advanced Encryption Standard process"), the World Cryptologic Competition
			looks to produce real value by production of innovative new algorithms, results, methods, and products (such as new cryptocurrencies).
		</p>
		<p>
			The WCC 2023 has 3 entry categories: Category A (Block Cipers), Category B (Digest Functions), and Category C (Stream Ciphers).
			In future years there will also be categories for analysis and invention- and perhaps others as well.

		<h3>Scoring</h3>
		<p>
			Scoring will be done on a 1-10 scale, in whole numbers, in 4 "files". 
			<ol>
				<li>1) Security (Most Important)</li>
				<li>2) Innovation</li>
				<li>3) Speed</li>
				<li>4) Aesthetics</li>
			</ol>
			Only in the case of a tie (equal averge score by all Judges) will the following file be considered.
			In the event of a full tie, first, it will be checked if the tie can be broken by only including scores from Distinguished Judges. If so,
			then that will be the result. If not, then the Judges will be asked to re-score. If the tie cannot be broken, then both entries will pass.

		<h3>Judges</h3>
		<p>
			WCC Judges are experts from academia and industry. The minimum requirements to be a judge is any of: An academic degree (MS or PhD)
			with a crypto-related specialization, published crypto-related academic work in a peer-reviewed setting, or well-known and studied
			open-source work in crypto.
		</p>
		<p>
			In WCC 2023 there are two classes of judge: "Judge", and "Distinguished Judge".
			There is no difference between the weight of vote from the two classes; but in the event of a true tie; if it is possible to break the tie
			by only counting votes from Distinguished Judges, then that will be done. In addition, Distinguished Judges are awarded more for their work.
			Examples of someone who would qualify to be a "Distinguished Judge" would be Kaisa Nyberg, Ron Rivest, Vincent Rijmen, John Kelsey, Don Coppersmith, or Bruce Schneier.
			Distinguished Judges, if any, will be chosen from the pool of Judges after the registration/submissions phase ends (Phase 1).
